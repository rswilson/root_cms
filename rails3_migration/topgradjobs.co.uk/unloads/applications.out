8|1|Maria|Llaneza|I'm Maria G Llaneza and I'm writting you regarding the Graduate Web Developer 25-30k  -  West London Job Offer I've just read in Gumtree. It sounds like a really good oportunity and I would like be taken in account in the selection process.\
\
I'm working for CSC Spain as a Global Incident Manager & EMEA Workflow Manager for a Global Account (Zurich Finantial Services). As it's a global account, I'm used to work in an international environment, dealing with people from differents countries and using English language as first language.\
\
Before that, I worked as Java/J2EE developer for almost 3 years in several projects, first for Capgemini Spain and after that for CSC Spain.\
\
Although I have some experience, I would like to start over again in London, that's why I don't want to miss this opportunity to join a UK growing software company.\
\
As you can see in my CV, I'd worked as Software developer in Spain and I have commercial experience in Web Technologies (css, html, php, javascript, j2ee).\
I could provide references if needed.\
\
Now I'm attending a course of AJAX, so I will be ready to work using AJAX as well.\
\
I've been traveling to the UK during the last year several times and I've decided to move there to try to build a solid career in the IT industry. Now I'm in Spain, but I've got a one way ticket to London for 11th April, so I could start working on 12th April.\
\
I’m still working in Spain and attending a course in the evening after work, so I’m not available most of the time. I would really appreciate that you contact me by email in first instance if you feel like I could fit in the position offered. Then we could schedule a phone meeting and if eventually I really have oportunities I could travel to London for a personal interview.\
\
I'm really motivated and excited with the idea of start working in London. I want to build a solid career in a professional environment.\
\
I have a strong desire for continuous improvement and that's the reason why I'm studing M.Sc. in Computer Science, attending an AJAX course and self-studing for Prince2 certifications.\
\
Apart from that, I'm going to live in Acton, so working in West London would be perfect for me!\
\
Thanks in advance for your time.\
\
Hope to hear from you.\
\
Kind regards,\
