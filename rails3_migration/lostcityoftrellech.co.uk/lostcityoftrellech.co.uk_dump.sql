Is it better to avoid this period for the experience day or doesn\'t it matter?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nEmma','2012-02-19 21:28:38','2012-02-19 21:28:38',3,140),(620,'E-mail','rswilsonuk@gmail.com','2012-02-20 21:22:52','2012-02-20 21:22:52',1,141),(621,'Subject','Test','2012-02-20 21:22:52','2012-02-20 21:22:52',2,141),(622,'Message','Confirming this is still working :)','2012-02-20 21:22:52','2012-02-20 21:22:52',3,141),(623,'E-mail','rswilsonuk@gmail.com','2012-02-20 21:34:24','2012-02-20 21:34:24',1,142),(624,'Subject','Test','2012-02-20 21:34:24','2012-02-20 21:34:24',2,142),(625,'Message','Test','2012-02-20 21:34:24','2012-02-20 21:34:24',3,142),(626,'E-mail','kayleighsmith@talktalk.net','2012-02-21 21:17:14','2012-02-21 21:17:14',1,143),(627,'Subject','volunteering','2012-02-21 21:17:14','2012-02-21 21:17:14',2,143),(628,'Message','I will be in Sept 2012, starting my masters degree in Regional History through the University of Wales, Newport, and would like to gain some experience of practical archaeology before hand.

I am looking at visiting my relatives in the UK this year and am interested in combining this with some volunteer work. I would love to come out to your site for a little while and could potentially stay for a week long experience in early August. I was wondering what other volunteers usually do, ie. accomodation wise, as coming from overseas with camping gear is likely to be a problem, so I was considering trying to stay somewhere close and hire a car for the week. Any other information you could provide me regarding the site and the upcoming season would be fantastic. I currently volunteer with the SA Museum Store, and by July I will have been on a surveying field trip to a site we will be excavating in september. \r\nThankyou,\r\nJessica ','2012-02-23 10:14:41','2012-02-23 10:14:41',3,144),(632,'Name','Ulyana Kononenko','2012-02-24 15:36:13','2012-02-24 15:36:13',4,145),(633,'E-mail','ulyakononenko@hotmail.com','2012-02-24 15:36:13','2012-02-24 15:36:13',5,145),(634,'Previous Experience','Yes','2012-02-24 15:36:13','2012-02-24 15:36:13',6,145),(635,'Available From','01/08/2012','2012-02-24 15:36:13','2012-02-24 15:36:13',15,145),(636,'Available To','14/08/2012','2012-02-24 15:36:13','2012-02-24 15:36:13',16,145),(637,'Comments','I\'m a student from Ukraine and would like to join your expedition. \r\nIf it\'s possible, please write me about that as quickly as you can.

The main building extends upwards of 225 square metres with the additional buildings adding another 105 square metres, each, and a courtyard that may extend over at least a couple of hundred metres.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Main Building</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Extension</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The main building is aligned onto the main Catbrook road as are all the buildings so far discovered. The main front wall lies a few metres back from the present road but has extensions added that run right up to it. The building appears to be of mediaeval construction with walls that are nearly one metre thick. The date of construction and then use is suggested by building techniques used to make the walls, relationships between walls and floors, (some floors have been dated) and that mediaeval finds makeup approximately two thirds of the finds. At the front of this building there are two large entranceways seemingly running into the same room that are positioned directly in front of main gate of the field. These entrances are both fully intact with a threshold stone across one and a large flagstone across the other. Here evidence for the mediaeval date of the building can be seen where the entrances are partially covered by a slag surface, an old road surface, which was then subsequently repaired using solely mediaeval roof tiles. The fact that this repair is using pottery from only the mediaeval period and that they are large freshly broken pieces suggests that they have not travelled far in terms of time or space. Thus if this slag surface is mediaeval the building that it abuts up against and partially covers must also be. This evidence for it being mediaeval would tally with other evidence previously mentioned found around the site.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Summary</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	However what is clear from both finds and structures that both the main mediaeval building and extension were both of significant status. That the main building was built first with the extension added later, but in the post-mediaeval period the main building may well have gone out of use before the later extension succumbed in the mid 1600&rsquo;s. Evidence of large amounts of charcoal from the destruction layer in the extension suggests it was destroyed by fire.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Additional Buildings</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	To the north, excavation has begun to reveal further buildings attached to the main building. These buildings seem to be older with solely mediaeval pottery, except for some very modern finds, being found. The building construction is also different with two or just a single stone spanning the walls that are a metre across unlike the mass wall construction seen in the rest of the site. Each stone is also at least half a metre deep. The full extent of the buildings are not yet clear but trial trenching and probing suggests they may extend upwards of 105 square metres, with the front wall running right up to the northern boundary of the field.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Courtyard</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	In addition to the buildings a courtyard of solid slag and/or stone with a drainage channel has been partly uncovered. This courtyard lies behind the buildings mentioned in the last paragraph and to the north of the main building. Probing suggests that it maybe quite extensive extending over at least a couple of hundred square metres. The date of its construction is not yet clear but it is located within what seems to be the earliest part of the site and mediaeval pottery found between the stone would suggest this as the likely date.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Overview</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Overall the buildings seem to be of significant status. The finds in terms of quantity and quality, the solid stone walls and floors and the planning of the spatial environment all lean towards the possibility that this is an important building with ancillary structures and later improvements. Although whether the site begun this way or was formed out of a series of small terraced burgages is not yet clear. The good variety of finds, further suggests the site had many different purposes and thus was not a simple farm. Additional evidence that it was not a farm but part of the mediaeval town of Trellech comes from previous archaeological work carried out in adjacent fields. Work done by Thames Valley Archaeology in 1998 (AW38) found three mediaeval burgages to the north of the site. Landscape archaeology carried out by Julia Wilson in 1998 (AW38) also suggested evidence for numerous buildings in adjacent fields. Also excavation by Monmouth Archaeology in 1999 (AW39) and by Monmouth Archaeological Society 2002 &ndash; 2004 (AW42&amp;44) have found mediaeval burgages on the opposite side of the road.

The main building extends upwards of 225 square metres with the additional buildings adding another 105 square metres, each, and a courtyard that may extend over at least a couple of hundred metres.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Main Building</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Extension</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The main building is aligned onto the main Catbrook road as are all the buildings so far discovered. The main front wall lies a few metres back from the present road but has extensions added that run right up to it. The building appears to be of mediaeval construction with walls that are nearly one metre thick. The date of construction and then use is suggested by building techniques used to make the walls, relationships between walls and floors, (some floors have been dated) and that mediaeval finds makeup approximately two thirds of the finds. At the front of this building there are two large entranceways seemingly running into the same room that are positioned directly in front of main gate of the field. These entrances are both fully intact with a threshold stone across one and a large flagstone across the other. Here evidence for the mediaeval date of the building can be seen where the entrances are partially covered by a slag surface, an old road surface, which was then subsequently repaired using solely mediaeval roof tiles. The fact that this repair is using pottery from only the mediaeval period and that they are large freshly broken pieces suggests that they have not travelled far in terms of time or space. Thus if this slag surface is mediaeval the building that it abuts up against and partially covers must also be. This evidence for it being mediaeval would tally with other evidence previously mentioned found around the site.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Summary</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	However what is clear from both finds and structures that both the main mediaeval building and extension were both of significant status. That the main building was built first with the extension added later, but in the post-mediaeval period the main building may well have gone out of use before the later extension succumbed in the mid 1600&rsquo;s. Evidence of large amounts of charcoal from the destruction layer in the extension suggests it was destroyed by fire.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Additional Buildings</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	To the north, excavation has begun to reveal further buildings attached to the main building. These buildings seem to be older with solely mediaeval pottery, except for some very modern finds, being found. The building construction is also different with two or just a single stone spanning the walls that are a metre across unlike the mass wall construction seen in the rest of the site. Each stone is also at least half a metre deep. The full extent of the buildings are not yet clear but trial trenching and probing suggests they may extend upwards of 105 square metres, with the front wall running right up to the northern boundary of the field.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Courtyard</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	In addition to the buildings a courtyard of solid slag and/or stone with a drainage channel has been partly uncovered. This courtyard lies behind the buildings mentioned in the last paragraph and to the north of the main building. Probing suggests that it maybe quite extensive extending over at least a couple of hundred square metres. The date of its construction is not yet clear but it is located within what seems to be the earliest part of the site and mediaeval pottery found between the stone would suggest this as the likely date.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n	Overview</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Overall the buildings seem to be of significant status. The finds in terms of quantity and quality, the solid stone walls and floors and the planning of the spatial environment all lean towards the possibility that this is an important building with ancillary structures and later improvements. Although whether the site begun this way or was formed out of a series of small terraced burgages is not yet clear.

These buildings seem to be older with solely mediaeval pottery, except for some very modern finds, being found. The building construction is also different with two or just a single stone spanning the walls that are a metre across unlike the mass wall construction seen in the rest of the site. Each stone is also at least half a metre deep. The full extent of the buildings are not yet clear but trial trenching and probing suggests they may extend upwards of 105 square metres, with the front wall running right up to the northern boundary of the field.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	Courtyard</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	In addition to the buildings a courtyard of solid slag and/or stone with a drainage channel has been partly uncovered.

For sometime there has been argument about the location of the nearly 400 burgages, (houses) recorded in history. Our third excavation proved along with other evidence that the location of the mediaeval city was outside the present village and not within it as previously thought.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The fourth and fifth excavations occurred on the present site and this season&rsquo;s work will explore further the archaeology uncovered during those previous digs. Last year a manor house with associated courtyards and a well were uncovered along with nearby buildings found during the 2005 excavation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Close to the surface and well preserved, the quality of the structures along with the artefacts found, suggests that these buildings were of some importance. Further excavation of all of the buildings should provide a better understanding of what they were used for, by whom and when and the well should provide further waterlogged material such as wood, leather and environmental data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This is an ongoing excavation to examine the scale and nature of the mediaeval city of Trellech. This is our sixth annual excavation and it is expected to carry on for many more years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Start at 10am on <strong>Saturday 16th July to Sunday 14th August</strong>, inclusive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Trellech</strong>: It is best reached by going first to Monmouth that is on the A40 dual carriage way in South Wales. From Monmouth follow the B4293 for about 6 miles in the direction of Chepstow. When arriving at Trellech, go through the village and leave taking the middle road up the hill, south, in the direction of Catbrook. Additionally there is also a train station at Chepstow and Newport. I can pick you up from there or alternatively there are bus services available. The Monmouth tourist information office has details of bus timetables and can be contacted on (01600) 713 899.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>The site</strong>: It is located a few hundred meters directly south of the present village at (SO 5020 0500). In the first field on the left after passing the speed limit signs, on the east side of the Catbrook road and next to Tinkers Lane. Cars can be parked along the side of the road and also on the wide verge.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Working times</strong>: Meet at the site 9:45 &ndash; 10:00 am. The day will normally be from 10am to 4pm but can be longer or shorter depending on the weather and how people are feeling. Lunch is normally around 12.30pm for half an hour. People are welcome to have other breaks if they think they need it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Amenities</strong>: There&nbsp;are two&nbsp;toilets on site along with a shower and a standpipe with drinkable water, all free to use. Lemonade, orange squash and biscuits including a large amount of Jaffa cakes will be available for refreshments but you are advised to bring your own lunches or there is a pub in the village.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Equipment</strong>: Trowels, hand shovels, kneeling mats, buckets, brushes, shovels and wheelbarrows are available for your use. Gloves are available but it is best if you bring your own. If you do bring your own equipment make sure it is clearly marked. There will be sun cream on site but you may want to bring your own. This is important as the site is exposed to the sun; do not forget to put it on.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Accommodation</strong>: Camping on site is available at a cost of &pound;3 per person per night. Amenities available as described above.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Cost</strong>: Free but donations are welcome.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Your participation is welcomed for all or part of the time.</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Replies or further enquiry&rsquo;s to: -</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Site Director Stuart Wilson</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Address: Inch Cottage, 5 Agincourt Street, Monmouth, Monmouthshire NP25 3DZ</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Telephone: (01600) 715 938</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	E-mail: monmouth_arc_society@talk21.com</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Website: www.lostcityoftrellech.co.uk</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	1988 winners of THE PITT-RIVERS AWARD for the best voluntary project<br />\r\n	1988 winners of THE LEGAL &amp; GENERAL SILVER TROWEL for the greatest initiative in Archaeology in Archaeology<br />\r\n	1992 Runners-up for the Pitt-Rivers Award</p>\r\n','upcoming_events.html',7,1,'2011-03-06 13:38:27','2011-03-06 13:38:27',1,3),(27,NULL,'Team Training','Team Training','<h1>\r\n	&nbsp;</h1>\r\n<meta content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" http-equiv=\"content-type\" />\r\n<h1>\r\n	Team Traingin</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	In 2011 will be offering management training and group training courses at the site.&nbsp;Please contact us below for more information:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	#FORM1#</p>\r\n','team_training.html',NULL,1,'2011-03-06 13:39:22','2011-03-06 13:39:22',1,21),(28,NULL,'Team Training','Team Training','<h1>\r\n	Team Training</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	In 2011 will be offering management training and group training courses at the site.&nbsp;Please contact us below for more information:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	#FORM1#</p>\r\n','team_training.html',NULL,1,'2011-03-06 13:39:35','2011-03-06 13:39:35',2,21),(29,1,'Team Training','Team Training','<h1>\r\n	Team Training</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	In 2011 will be offering management training and group training courses at the site.&nbsp;Please contact us below for more information:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	#FORM1#</p>\r\n','team_training.html',7,1,'2011-03-06 13:39:56','2011-03-06 13:39:56',3,21),(30,1,'Team Training','Team Training','<h1>\r\n	Team Training</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	In 2011 will be offering management training and group training courses at the site.&nbsp;Please contact us below for more information:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	#FORM3#</p>\r\n','team_training.html',7,1,'2011-03-06 13:41:46','2011-03-06 13:41:46',4,21),(31,1,'Press Coverage','Press Coverage','<title></title>\r\n<p>\r\n	The Lost City of Trellech Project has been receiving a significant amount of coverage in the British media.

Once of largest city in Wales it now lies in fields just outside the village of Trellech that is situated on its northern edge. An industrial town producing iron principally for the De Clares army it began life in 1245 A.D. and grew rapidly to become approximately &frac14; the size of London. The death of the De Clares in 1314 weakened it and the subsequent effects of climate change, plague and war saw it decline further.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		The present site is part of an ongoing excavation. Already the foundations of several houses including one manor house with a round tower and well have been discovered. All the buildings so far have been built in stone and may well have given the city its name of Trellech, Tre meaning town and llech meaning stone, i.e stone town.&nbsp; Substantial remains exist which allow both the archaeologist and the visitor to gain a good idea of how things would have existed. Numerous finds have also been uncovered and continue to do so. Discoveries have included a nearly complete pot over 600 years old, leather shoes, wooden objects, bronze buckles, including a buckle glided in gold as well as numerous pieces of pots, iron and stone.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		<strong>How to Purchase:</strong></p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		When you purchase (for yourself or as a gift) you will immediately receive a gift pack with a gift voucher confirming that you have bought an experience day (date to be mutually agreed) and diggers pack along with an information booklet.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		<strong><strong>Only &pound;45.00</strong></strong>&nbsp;per person (discounts for additional people)</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		To purchase an experience day use the PayPal checkout below or contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:%20monmouth_arc_society@talk21.com\" style=\"text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(158, 158, 158); \">Stuart Wilson</a>&nbsp;(Tel No. 01600 715938)</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		Experience days can take place at anytime of the year but you are advised to book early to avoid disappointment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n	<br />\r\n	<input alt=\"Make payments with PayPal - it\'s fast, free and secure!\" name=\"submit\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/btn/sc-but-03.gif\" type=\"image\" /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" /> <input name=\"add\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /> <input name=\"cmd\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"_cart\" /> <input name=\"business\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"stuart_wilson@talk21.com\" /> <input name=\"item_name\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"Archaeological Experience Day\" /> <input name=\"amount\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"45.00\" /> <input name=\"no_shipping\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"2\" /> <input name=\"return\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"http://www.lostcityoftrellech.co.uk/success.html\" /> <input name=\"no_note\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /> <input name=\"currency_code\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"GBP\" /> <input name=\"lc\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"GB\" /> <input name=\"bn\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"PP-ShopCartBF\" /></form>\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n	<input name=\"cmd\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"_cart\" /> <input name=\"business\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"stuart_wilson@talk21.com\" /> <input alt=\"Make payments with PayPal - it\'s fast, free and secure!\" name=\"submit\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/btn/view_cart.gif\" type=\"image\" /> <input name=\"display\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /></form>\r\n','archaeological_experience_day.html',2,1,'2011-03-13 23:29:37','2011-03-13 23:29:37',1,13),(43,1,'Archaeological Experience Day','Archaeological Experience Day','<h1>\r\n	Archaeological Experience Day</h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	<img alt=\"Experience Day\" src=\"../../../site_files/images/experiencepack_large.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 287px; \" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); \">\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n		<span style=\"font-size: 24px; \"><strong>Become an archaeologist for a day!</strong></span></p>\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n		<strong><em>Adventure, Explore and Dig on a real Archaeological Excavation...</em></strong><strong><em>As seen on TV!</em></strong></p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		Explore the Lost City of Trellech, once the largest Medieval City in Wales, set in the heart of the Welsh countryside.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		Take part in the adventure and discover for yourself ancient relics on the excavation of this forgotten city.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		This archaeological adventure will take you on a journey into the past.

Discoveries have included a nearly complete pot over 600 years old, leather shoes, wooden objects, bronze buckles, including a buckle glided in gold as well as numerous pieces of pots, iron and stone.</p>\r\n	<h2>\r\n		<strong>How to Purchase:</strong></h2>\r\n	<p>\r\n		When you purchase (for yourself or as a gift) you will immediately receive a gift pack with a gift voucher confirming that you have bought an experience day (date to be mutually agreed) and diggers pack along with an information booklet.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		<strong><strong>Only &pound;45.00</strong></strong>&nbsp;per person (discounts for additional people)</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		To purchase an experience day use the PayPal checkout below or contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:%20monmouth_arc_society@talk21.com\" style=\"text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(158, 158, 158); \">Stuart Wilson</a>&nbsp;(Tel No. 01600 715938)</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		Experience days can take place at anytime of the year but you are advised to book early to avoid disappointment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n	<br />\r\n	<input alt=\"Make payments with PayPal - it\'s fast, free and secure!\" name=\"submit\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/btn/sc-but-03.gif\" type=\"image\" /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" /> <input name=\"add\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /> <input name=\"cmd\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"_cart\" /> <input name=\"business\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"stuart_wilson@talk21.com\" /> <input name=\"item_name\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"Archaeological Experience Day\" /> <input name=\"amount\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"45.00\" /> <input name=\"no_shipping\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"2\" /> <input name=\"return\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"http://www.lostcityoftrellech.co.uk/success.html\" /> <input name=\"no_note\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /> <input name=\"currency_code\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"GBP\" /> <input name=\"lc\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"GB\" /> <input name=\"bn\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"PP-ShopCartBF\" /></form>\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n	<input name=\"cmd\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"_cart\" /> <input name=\"business\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"stuart_wilson@talk21.com\" /> <input alt=\"Make payments with PayPal - it\'s fast, free and secure!\" name=\"submit\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/btn/view_cart.gif\" type=\"image\" /> <input name=\"display\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /></form>\r\n','archaeological_experience_day.html',2,1,'2011-03-13 23:30:49','2011-03-13 23:30:49',2,13),(44,1,'Archaeological Experience Day','Archaeological Experience Day','<h1>\r\n	Archaeological Experience Day</h1>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	<img alt=\"Experience Day\" src=\"../../../site_files/images/experiencepack_large.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 287px; \" /></p>\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); \">\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n		<span style=\"font-size: 24px; \"><strong>Become an archaeologist for a day!</strong></span></p>\r\n	<p style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n		<strong><em>Adventure, Explore and Dig on a real Archaeological Excavation...</em></strong><strong><em>As seen on TV!</em></strong></p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		Explore the Lost City of Trellech, once the largest Medieval City in Wales, set in the heart of the Welsh countryside.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		Take part in the adventure and discover for yourself ancient relics on the excavation of this forgotten city.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		This archaeological adventure will take you on a journey into the past.

Once of largest city in Wales it now lies in fields just outside the village of Trellech that is situated on its northern edge. An industrial town producing iron principally for the De Clares army it began life in 1245 A.D. and grew rapidly to become approximately &frac14; the size of London. The death of the De Clares in 1314 weakened it and the subsequent effects of climate change, plague and war saw it decline further.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		The present site is part of an ongoing excavation. Already the foundations of several houses including one manor house with a round tower and well have been discovered. All the buildings so far have been built in stone and may well have given the city its name of Trellech, Tre meaning town and llech meaning stone, i.e stone town.&nbsp; Substantial remains exist which allow both the archaeologist and the visitor to gain a good idea of how things would have existed. Numerous finds have also been uncovered and continue to do so. Discoveries have included a nearly complete pot over 600 years old, leather shoes, wooden objects, bronze buckles, including a buckle glided in gold as well as numerous pieces of pots, iron and stone.</p>\r\n	<h2>\r\n		<strong>How to Purchase:</strong></h2>\r\n	<p>\r\n		When you purchase (for yourself or as a gift) you will immediately receive a gift pack with a gift voucher confirming that you have bought an experience day (date to be mutually agreed) and diggers pack along with an information booklet.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		<strong><strong>Only &pound;45.00</strong></strong>&nbsp;per person (discounts for additional people)</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		To purchase an experience day use the PayPal checkout below or contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:%20monmouth_arc_society@talk21.com\" style=\"text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: rgb(158, 158, 158); \">Stuart Wilson</a>&nbsp;(Tel No. 01600 715938)</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		Experience days can take place at anytime of the year but you are advised to book early to avoid disappointment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n	<br />\r\n	<input alt=\"Make payments with PayPal - it\'s fast, free and secure!\" name=\"submit\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/btn/sc-but-03.gif\" type=\"image\" /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" /> <input name=\"add\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /> <input name=\"cmd\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"_cart\" /> <input name=\"business\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"stuart_wilson@talk21.com\" /> <input name=\"item_name\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"Archaeological Experience Day\" /> <input name=\"amount\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"45.00\" /> <input name=\"no_shipping\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"2\" /> <input name=\"return\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"http://www.lostcityoftrellech.co.uk/success.html\" /> <input name=\"no_note\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /> <input name=\"currency_code\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"GBP\" /> <input name=\"lc\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"GB\" /> <input name=\"bn\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"PP-ShopCartBF\" /></form>\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n	<input name=\"cmd\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"_cart\" /> <input name=\"business\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"stuart_wilson@talk21.com\" /> <input alt=\"Make payments with PayPal - it\'s fast, free and secure!\" name=\"submit\" src=\"https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/btn/view_cart.gif\" type=\"image\" /> <input name=\"display\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"1\" /></form>\r\n','archaeological_experience_day.html',2,1,'2011-03-13 23:31:05','2011-03-13 23:31:05',3,13),(45,1,'Upcoming Events','Upcoming Events','<h1>\r\n	Upcoming Events</h1>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Trellech 2011 ~ Tenth Annual Excavation ~ Saturday 16th July to Sunday 14th August 2011</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Archaeological Festival ~ Open Weekends ~ The weekends of 23rd &amp; 24th and 30th &amp; 31st July 2011</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	MONMOUTH ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	President : A.

For sometime there has been argument about the location of the nearly 400 burgages, (houses) recorded in history. Our third excavation proved along with other evidence that the location of the mediaeval city was outside the present village and not within it as previously thought.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The fourth and fifth excavations occurred on the present site and this season&rsquo;s work will explore further the archaeology uncovered during those previous digs. Last year a manor house with associated courtyards and a well were uncovered along with nearby buildings found during the 2005 excavation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Close to the surface and well preserved, the quality of the structures along with the artefacts found, suggests that these buildings were of some importance. Further excavation of all of the buildings should provide a better understanding of what they were used for, by whom and when and the well should provide further waterlogged material such as wood, leather and environmental data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This is an ongoing excavation to examine the scale and nature of the mediaeval city of Trellech. This is our sixth annual excavation and it is expected to carry on for many more years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Start at 10am on <strong>Saturday 16th July to Sunday 14th August</strong>, inclusive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Trellech</strong>: It is best reached by going first to Monmouth that is on the A40 dual carriage way in South Wales. From Monmouth follow the B4293 for about 6 miles in the direction of Chepstow. When arriving at Trellech, go through the village and leave taking the middle road up the hill, south, in the direction of Catbrook. Additionally there is also a train station at Chepstow and Newport. I can pick you up from there or alternatively there are bus services available. The Monmouth tourist information office has details of bus timetables and can be contacted on (01600) 713 899.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>The site</strong>: It is located a few hundred meters directly south of the present village at (SO 5020 0500). In the first field on the left after passing the speed limit signs, on the east side of the Catbrook road and next to Tinkers Lane. Cars can be parked along the side of the road and also on the wide verge.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Working times</strong>: Meet at the site 9:45 &ndash; 10:00 am. The day will normally be from 10am to 4pm but can be longer or shorter depending on the weather and how people are feeling. Lunch is normally around 12.30pm for half an hour. People are welcome to have other breaks if they think they need it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Amenities</strong>: There&nbsp;are two&nbsp;toilets on site along with a shower and a standpipe with drinkable water, all free to use. Lemonade, orange squash and biscuits including a large amount of Jaffa cakes will be available for refreshments but you are advised to bring your own lunches or there is a pub in the village.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Equipment</strong>: Trowels, hand shovels, kneeling mats, buckets, brushes, shovels and wheelbarrows are available for your use. Gloves are available but it is best if you bring your own. If you do bring your own equipment make sure it is clearly marked. There will be sun cream on site but you may want to bring your own. This is important as the site is exposed to the sun; do not forget to put it on.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Accommodation</strong>: Camping on site is available at a cost of &pound;3 per person per night. Amenities available as described above.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Cost</strong>: Free but donations are welcome.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Your participation is welcomed for all or part of the time.</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Replies or further enquiry&rsquo;s to: -</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Site Director Stuart Wilson</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Address: Inch Cottage, 5 Agincourt Street, Monmouth, Monmouthshire NP25 3DZ</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Telephone: (01600) 715 938</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	E-mail: monmouth_arc_society@talk21.com</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Website: www.lostcityoftrellech.co.uk</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	1988 winners of THE PITT-RIVERS AWARD for the best voluntary project<br />\r\n	1988 winners of THE LEGAL &amp; GENERAL SILVER TROWEL for the greatest initiative in Archaeology in Archaeology<br />\r\n	1992 Runners-up for the Pitt-Rivers Award</p>\r\n','upcoming_events.html',7,1,'2011-03-13 23:36:11','2011-03-13 23:36:11',2,3),(46,1,'Homepage','Welcome to the Lost City of Trellech Project','<h1>\r\n	Welcome</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	Hello there and welcome to the home of the Lost City Of Trellech.

For sometime there has been argument about the location of the nearly 400 burgages, (houses) recorded in history. Our third excavation proved along with other evidence that the location of the mediaeval city was outside the present village and not within it as previously thought.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The fourth and fifth excavations occurred on the present site and this season&rsquo;s work will explore further the archaeology uncovered during those previous digs. Last year a manor house with associated courtyards and a well were uncovered along with nearby buildings found during the 2005 excavation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Close to the surface and well preserved, the quality of the structures along with the artefacts found, suggests that these buildings were of some importance. Further excavation of all of the buildings should provide a better understanding of what they were used for, by whom and when and the well should provide further waterlogged material such as wood, leather and environmental data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This is an ongoing excavation to examine the scale and nature of the mediaeval city of Trellech. This is our sixth annual excavation and it is expected to carry on for many more years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Start at 10am on <strong>Saturday 16th July to Sunday 14th August</strong>, inclusive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Trellech</strong>: It is best reached by going first to Monmouth that is on the A40 dual carriage way in South Wales. From Monmouth follow the B4293 for about 6 miles in the direction of Chepstow. When arriving at Trellech, go through the village and leave taking the middle road up the hill, south, in the direction of Catbrook. Additionally there is also a train station at Chepstow and Newport. I can pick you up from there or alternatively there are bus services available. The Monmouth tourist information office has details of bus timetables and can be contacted on (01600) 713 899.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>The site</strong>: It is located a few hundred meters directly south of the present village at (SO 5020 0500). In the first field on the left after passing the speed limit signs, on the east side of the Catbrook road and next to Tinkers Lane. Cars can be parked along the side of the road and also on the wide verge.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Working times</strong>: Meet at the site 9:45 &ndash; 10:00 am. The day will normally be from 10am to 4pm but can be longer or shorter depending on the weather and how people are feeling. Lunch is normally around 12.30pm for half an hour. People are welcome to have other breaks if they think they need it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Amenities</strong>: There&nbsp;are two&nbsp;toilets on site along with a shower and a standpipe with drinkable water, all free to use. Lemonade, orange squash and biscuits including a large amount of Jaffa cakes will be available for refreshments but you are advised to bring your own lunches or there is a pub in the village.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Equipment</strong>: Trowels, hand shovels, kneeling mats, buckets, brushes, shovels and wheelbarrows are available for your use. Gloves are available but it is best if you bring your own. If you do bring your own equipment make sure it is clearly marked. There will be sun cream on site but you may want to bring your own. This is important as the site is exposed to the sun; do not forget to put it on.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Accommodation</strong>: Camping on site is available at a cost of &pound;3 per person per night. Amenities available as described above. Alternatively, if camping is not your style, there are plenty of other options to stay in the local area.

Once of largest city in Wales it now lies in fields just outside the village of Trellech that is situated on its northern edge. An industrial town producing iron principally for the De Clares army it began life in 1245 A.D. and grew rapidly to become approximately &frac14; the size of London. The death of the De Clares in 1314 weakened it and the subsequent effects of climate change, plague and war saw it decline further.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		The present site is part of an ongoing excavation. Already the foundations of several houses including one manor house with a round tower and well have been discovered. All the buildings so far have been built in stone and may well have given the city its name of Trellech, Tre meaning town and llech meaning stone, i.e stone town.&nbsp; Substantial remains exist which allow both the archaeologist and the visitor to gain a good idea of how things would have existed. Numerous finds have also been uncovered and continue to do so.

Once of largest city in Wales it now lies in fields just outside the village of Trellech that is situated on its northern edge. An industrial town producing iron principally for the De Clares army it began life in 1245 A.D. and grew rapidly to become approximately &frac14; the size of London. The death of the De Clares in 1314 weakened it and the subsequent effects of climate change, plague and war saw it decline further.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The present site is part of an ongoing excavation. Already the foundations of several houses including one manor house with a round tower and well have been discovered. All the buildings so far have been built in stone and may well have given the city its name of Trellech, Tre meaning town and llech meaning stone, i.e stone town.&nbsp; Substantial remains exist which allow both the archaeologist and the visitor to gain a good idea of how things would have existed. Numerous finds have also been uncovered and continue to do so. Discoveries have included a nearly complete pot over 600 years old, leather shoes, wooden objects, bronze buckles, including a buckle glided in gold as well as numerous pieces of pots, iron and stone.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>How to Purchase:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	When you purchase (for yourself or as a gift) you will immediately receive a gift pack with a gift voucher confirming that you have bought an experience day (date to be mutually agreed) and diggers pack along with an information booklet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong><strong>Cost is &pound;45</strong></strong> per person (discounts for additional people)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	To purchase an experience day <a href=\"../../Merchandise/archaeological_experience_day.html\">click here</a> or contact <a href=\"mailto:%20monmouth_arc_society@talk21.com\" style=\"text-decoration: none; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #9e9e9e;\">Stuart Wilson</a> (Tel No. 01600 715938)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Experience days can take place at anytime of the year but you are advised to book early to avoid disappointment.</p>\r\n','archaeological_experience_day.html',NULL,1,'2011-06-05 23:20:44','2011-06-05 23:20:44',1,16),(79,1,'Get Involved','Get Involved!','<h1>\r\n	Get Involved!</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	The LostCityofTrellech project is always on the look out for more willing volunteers.

Our third excavation proved along with other evidence that the location of the mediaeval city was outside the present village and not within it as previously thought.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The fourth and fifth excavations occurred on the present site and this season&rsquo;s work will explore further the archaeology uncovered during those previous digs. Last year a manor house with associated courtyards and a well were uncovered along with nearby buildings found during the 2005 excavation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Close to the surface and well preserved, the quality of the structures along with the artefacts found, suggests that these buildings were of some importance. Further excavation of all of the buildings should provide a better understanding of what they were used for, by whom and when and the well should provide further waterlogged material such as wood, leather and environmental data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This is an ongoing excavation to examine the scale and nature of the mediaeval city of Trellech.

When arriving at Trellech, go through the village and leave taking the middle road up the hill, south, in the direction of Catbrook. Additionally there is also a train station at Chepstow and Newport. I can pick you up from there or alternatively there are bus services available.

Within the manor house complex we have discovered several different rooms one with a fireplace and chimney stack and one with a central fireplace. At the centre of the courtyard lies a well in which many interesting finds have been uncovered including a nearly complete mediaeval pot, metal work, wooden objects and parts of leather shoes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Surrounding the manor house at parts of at least five other buildings have been discovered as well as a possible horse pond to the rear. In all, these buildings seem to date from 1300 A.D. when the town was reorganised and built in stone after the attacks by both English and Welsh forces in the previous decade. Evidence of the earlier town has been found below some of the buildings and occupation on the site may have started 100 years previously. By 1400 some of the buildings had fallen into ruin and by 1650 after the civil war the last of the buildings were abandoned.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Excavation on a nearby field started in 2002 with excavation on this site starting in 2005. The excavation site covers most of the east side of the High Street as well as 3/4 of on side of a minor side road/lane. It is the aim of this excavation to gain a better insight into the nature and workings of Trellech, once Wales&#39;s largest urban centre and provide an educational resource for all.</p>\r\n','site_info.html',5,1,'2012-07-16 12:37:14','2012-07-16 12:37:14',4,22),(89,1,'Site Location','Site Location','<h2>\r\n	Getting here by car</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	The nearest postcode to the site is <strong>NP25 4PE</strong>.

For sometime there has been argument about the location of the nearly 400 burgages, (houses) recorded in history. Our third excavation proved along with other evidence that the location of the mediaeval city was outside the present village and not within it as previously thought.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The fourth and fifth excavations occurred on the present site and this season&rsquo;s work will explore further the archaeology uncovered during those previous digs. Last year a manor house with associated courtyards and a well were uncovered along with nearby buildings found during the 2005 excavation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Close to the surface and well preserved, the quality of the structures along with the artefacts found, suggests that these buildings were of some importance. Further excavation of all of the buildings should provide a better understanding of what they were used for, by whom and when and the well should provide further waterlogged material such as wood, leather and environmental data.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This is an ongoing excavation to examine the scale and nature of the mediaeval city of Trellech. This is our sixth annual excavation and it is expected to carry on for many more years.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Start at 10am on <strong>Saturday 16th July to Sunday 14th August</strong>, inclusive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Trellech</strong>: It is best reached by going first to Monmouth that is on the A40 dual carriage way in South Wales. From Monmouth follow the B4293 for about 6 miles in the direction of Chepstow. When arriving at Trellech, go through the village and leave taking the middle road up the hill, south, in the direction of Catbrook. Additionally there is also a train station at Chepstow and Newport. I can pick you up from there or alternatively there are bus services available. The Monmouth tourist information office has details of bus timetables and can be contacted on (01600) 713 899.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>The site</strong>: It is located a few hundred meters directly south of the present village at (SO 5020 0500). In the first field on the left after passing the speed limit signs, on the east side of the Catbrook road and next to Tinkers Lane. Cars can be parked along the side of the road and also on the wide verge.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Working times</strong>: Meet at the site 9:45 &ndash; 10:00 am. The day will normally be from 10am to 4pm but can be longer or shorter depending on the weather and how people are feeling. Lunch is normally around 12.30pm for half an hour. People are welcome to have other breaks if they think they need it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Amenities</strong>: There&nbsp;are two&nbsp;toilets on site along with a shower and a standpipe with drinkable water, all free to use. Lemonade, orange squash and biscuits including a large amount of Jaffa cakes will be available for refreshments but you are advised to bring your own lunches or there is a pub in the village.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Equipment</strong>: Trowels, hand shovels, kneeling mats, buckets, brushes, shovels and wheelbarrows are available for your use. Gloves are available but it is best if you bring your own. If you do bring your own equipment make sure it is clearly marked. There will be sun cream on site but you may want to bring your own.

This is further strong evidence for the town of Trellech, once the largest in Wales, to be principally situated along the Catbrook road to the south of the present villa</p>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<h3>\r\n	Summary of the dig so far. What has been found?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	We have discovered a Manor House with two halls and a courtyard that is enclosed with curtain walls and a massive Round Tower six metres across. Within the manor house complex we have discovered several different rooms one with a fireplace and chimney stack and one with a central fireplace. At the centre of the courtyard lies a well in which many interesting finds have been uncovered including a nearly complete mediaeval pot, metal work, wooden objects and parts of leather shoes. Surrounding the manor house at parts of at least five other buildings have been discovered as well as a possible horse pond to the rear. In all, these buildings seem to date from 1300 A.D. when the town was reorganised and built in stone after the attacks by both English and Welsh forces in the previous decade. Evidence of the earlier town has been found below some of the buildings and occupation on the site may have started 100 years previously. By 1400 some of the buildings had fallen into ruin and by 1650 after the civil war the last of the buildings were abandoned.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Excavation on a nearby field started in 2002 with excavation on this site starting in 2005. The excavation site covers most of the east side of the High Street as well as 3/4 of on side of a minor side road/lane. It is the aim of this excavation to gain a better insight into the nature and workings of Trellech, once Wales&#39;s largest urban centre and provide an educational resource for all.</p>\r\n','excavation_project.html',5,1,'2009-12-17 13:52:27','2011-03-13 23:46:27',4),(5,1,'Contact','Contact','<p>\r\n	If you would like to contact me regarding anything concerning the Lost City of Trellech, please do not hesitate.

Once of largest city in Wales it now lies in fields just outside the village of Trellech that is situated on its northern edge. An industrial town producing iron principally for the De Clares army it began life in 1245 A.D. and grew rapidly to become approximately &frac14; the size of London. The death of the De Clares in 1314 weakened it and the subsequent effects of climate change, plague and war saw it decline further.</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n		The present site is part of an ongoing excavation. Already the foundations of several houses including one manor house with a round tower and well have been discovered. All the buildings so far have been built in stone and may well have given the city its name of Trellech, Tre meaning town and llech meaning stone, i.e stone town.&nbsp; Substantial remains exist which allow both the archaeologist and the visitor to gain a good idea of how things would have existed. Numerous finds have also been uncovered and continue to do so. Discoveries have included a nearly complete pot over 600 years old, leather shoes, wooden objects, bronze buckles, including a buckle glided in gold as well as numerous pieces of pots, iron and stone.</p>\r\n	<h2>\r\n		<strong>Where to Stay:</strong></h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n<div style=\"font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); \">\r\n	The Experience Day itselfs lasts for a single day.

The main building extends upwards of 225 square metres with the additional buildings adding another 105 square metres, each, and a courtyard that may extend over at least a couple of hundred metres.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	Main Building</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	The main building is aligned onto the main Catbrook road as are all the buildings so far discovered. The main front wall lies a few metres back from the present road but has extensions added that run right up to it. The building appears to be of mediaeval construction with walls that are nearly one metre thick. The date of construction and then use is suggested by building techniques used to make the walls, relationships between walls and floors, (some floors have been dated) and that mediaeval finds makeup approximately two thirds of the finds. At the front of this building there are two large entranceways seemingly running into the same room that are positioned directly in front of main gate of the field. These entrances are both fully intact with a threshold stone across one and a large flagstone across the other. Here evidence for the mediaeval date of the building can be seen where the entrances are partially covered by a slag surface, an old road surface, which was then subsequently repaired using solely mediaeval roof tiles. The fact that this repair is using pottery from only the mediaeval period and that they are large freshly broken pieces suggests that they have not travelled far in terms of time or space. Thus if this slag surface is mediaeval the building that it abuts up against and partially covers must also be. This evidence for it being mediaeval would tally with other evidence previously mentioned found around the site.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	Summary</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	However what is clear from both finds and structures that both the main mediaeval building and extension were both of significant status. That the main building was built first with the extension added later, but in the post-mediaeval period the main building may well have gone out of use before the later extension succumbed in the mid 1600&rsquo;s. Evidence of large amounts of charcoal from the destruction layer in the extension suggests it was destroyed by fire.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	Additional Buildings</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	To the north, excavation has begun to reveal further buildings attached to the main building. These buildings seem to be older with solely mediaeval pottery, except for some very modern finds, being found. The building construction is also different with two or just a single stone spanning the walls that are a metre across unlike the mass wall construction seen in the rest of the site. Each stone is also at least half a metre deep. The full extent of the buildings are not yet clear but trial trenching and probing suggests they may extend upwards of 105 square metres, with the front wall running right up to the northern boundary of the field.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	Courtyard</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	In addition to the buildings a courtyard of solid slag and/or stone with a drainage channel has been partly uncovered. This courtyard lies behind the buildings mentioned in the last paragraph and to the north of the main building. Probing suggests that it maybe quite extensive extending over at least a couple of hundred square metres. The date of its construction is not yet clear but it is located within what seems to be the earliest part of the site and mediaeval pottery found between the stone would suggest this as the likely date.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	Overview</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Overall the buildings seem to be of significant status. The finds in terms of quantity and quality, the solid stone walls and floors and the planning of the spatial environment all lean towards the possibility that this is an important building with ancillary structures and later improvements. Although whether the site begun this way or was formed out of a series of small terraced burgages is not yet clear. The good variety of finds, further suggests the site had many different purposes and thus was not a simple farm. Additional evidence that it was not a farm but part of the mediaeval town of Trellech comes from previous archaeological work carried out in adjacent fields. Work done by Thames Valley Archaeology in 1998 (AW38) found three mediaeval burgages to the north of the site. Landscape archaeology carried out by Julia Wilson in 1998 (AW38) also suggested evidence for numerous buildings in adjacent fields. Also excavation by Monmouth Archaeology in 1999 (AW39) and by Monmouth Archaeological Society 2002 &ndash; 2004 (AW42&amp;44) have found mediaeval burgages on the opposite side of the road. This combined evidence shows a concentrated linear settlement along the Catbrook road and not a dispersed settlement as is normally settlement pattern for farms in this area.</p>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; \">\r\n	Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	Overall it is clear that this part of Trellech began around 1250 and became an important building complex that lasted at least in part until the mid 1600&rsquo;s. This is further strong evidence for the town of Trellech, once the largest in Wales, to be principally situated along the Catbrook road to the south of the present villa</p>\r\n','results_2005.html',5,1,'2011-03-05 00:26:00','2011-03-05 00:34:23',10),(18,1,'Results for 2010','Results for 2010','<h1>\r\n	Summary of Results of 2010 Season</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	Information about the Excavation Project 2010, to be updated shortly</p>\r\n','results_2010.html',5,1,'2011-03-05 00:27:14','2011-03-05 00:34:04',3),(19,1,'Media','Media','<h1>\r\n	Media</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	Here you can find out a little more about the project.

Within the manor house complex we have discovered several different rooms one with a fireplace and chimney stack and one with a central fireplace. At the centre of the courtyard lies a well in which many interesting finds have been uncovered including a nearly complete mediaeval pot, metal work, wooden objects and parts of leather shoes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Surrounding the manor house at parts of at least five other buildings have been discovered as well as a possible horse pond to the rear. In all, these buildings seem to date from 1300 A.D. when the town was reorganised and built in stone after the attacks by both English and Welsh forces in the previous decade. Evidence of the earlier town has been found below some of the buildings and occupation on the site may have started 100 years previously. By 1400 some of the buildings had fallen into ruin and by 1650 after the civil war the last of the buildings were abandoned.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Excavation on a nearby field started in 2002 with excavation on this site starting in 2005. The excavation site covers most of the east side of the High Street as well as 3/4 of on side of a minor side road/lane. It is the aim of this excavation to gain a better insight into the nature and workings of Trellech, once Wales&#39;s largest urban centre and provide an educational resource for all.</p>\r\n','site_info.html',5,1,'2011-03-13 23:25:04','2012-07-16 12:37:14',4),(23,1,'Order Success','Order Success','<h1>\r\n	Order Success</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n	Thank you for purchasing an Archaeological Experience Day.
