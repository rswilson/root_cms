<h2>RootCMS (what this site is running on!)</h2>\
<p>RootCMS is my attempt at a simple lightweight content management system for the web. I was getting increasingly frustrated finding a solution for friends and family who wanted websites. The problems they had:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>Want something simple!</li>\
<li>Don't want it too simple! Blogger et al. all have their limitations</li>\
<li>Dreamweaver and tools are awkward to learn, produce horrible code and still leaves a lot of manual leg work</li>\
</ul>\
<p>I looked around the internet for free CMS and found great examples like Joomla but I was just got increasingly frustrated by them. They were just far too complicated. The Open Source community is great and all, but when so many people request features and plugins then the key vision of the software is lost. I wanted to cut away the fat and make a basic, simple, easy to use, clean CMS. So I hope this is what I achieved</p>\

<p>Simple, lightweight, easy to use CMS? Is it possible?</p>\
</div>\
<h1>RootCMS</h1>\
<p>RootCMS is my take on a CMS. It was written out of a passion to provide a simple CMS for me, my friends and my family. I also used it as an excuse to learn some news skill using Ruby on Rails.</p>\
<p>I'm pretty proud of it. This whole site is running in RootCMS and I am writing this content inside of it as we speak. It is still a work in progress and hopefully new features will come.</p>\
<h2>What?</h2>\
<p>RootCMS is a light, easy to use CMS. I don't claim that it does everything, it does the basics and I feel it does them well. More will come, but so far here is the features list:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>Page Templates</li>\
<li>Page Content</li>\
<li>Folders</li>\
<li>Menus</li>\
<li>File Manager</li>\
<li>Photos, Albums and Galleries</li>\
</ul>\
<h2>How?</h2>\
<p>RootCMS is built using the Ruby on Rail framework. I originally became interested in Ruby on Rails a few years back when it originally came to life. I had done a few small sites in it, but nothing on this scale or complexity. I have really learnt a lot with this project and am please with the results.</p>\
<p>I have found Rails to be a real productivity win for me. I like achieving things rapidly. Iterating the product until I am happy with it. It removes a lot of the frustrating barriers of Web development</p>\
<h2>Where can I get it?</h2>\
<p>I am currently reworking RootCMS into a plugin for Rails so that you can easily add CMS functionality into your project. This will be open source and hosted on GitHub.</p>\
<p>Until then, you can view the project's progress in my <a href="http://git.rswilson.com">git repository</a>.</p>|rootcms.html|1|1|2010-01-29 15:18:38|2010-01-29 15:19:04
